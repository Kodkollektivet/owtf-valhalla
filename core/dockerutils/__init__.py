"""
This module takes care of all the Docker stuff.

When the application starts we will iterate over all of the
containers that lives in 'owtfvalhalla/containers' and build
OwtfContainer objects.
The OwtfContainer object can interact with image/container,
give IP address of running container, give all the information
that is relevant to a container/image.
